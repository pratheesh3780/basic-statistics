Gopinath, Dr. Manju Mary Paul 2022-01-30 Welcome Welcome to the book Introduction to Agricultural Statistics. "],["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy. Over 70 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture. To ensure food security to the growing population, active research is an inevitable part for developing procedures to increase livestock and crop yields, improve farmland productivity, reduce loss due to post harvest handling, manage disease and insects, develop more efficient equipment and to increase overall food quality. A lot of scientist and students are involved in this process. Surveys, field and lab experiments are an integral part of agricultural research. All these actions generate, what we call data, which need to be carefully examined, understood and visualized for making valid scientific interpretations and conclusions. Statistics, the science of collecting, analysing, presenting, and interpreting data plays an important role in agricultural research and survey. Knowledge in statistics helps you to use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, and effectively present the results. Statistics as a subject is very hard to learn, but if presented in a proper way, it is very fun and interesting. Majority of students and researchers in agriculture and allied sciences didnt have a mathematical background, which makes it even harder for them to learn and understand the concepts. Students takes up this subject seriously for their post graduate and PhD programme, as it is very much required for their research work, usually they didnt get a chance to brush up the very basics they learned during their graduation. But remember you cant build a great building on a weak foundation. Statistics is very much needed now, not only in the field of Agriculture, but in all other fields including medical research. Basic statistical concept remain same, but what changes with the field of study is the statistical tool employed. Before learning about statistical tools, to apply in your research the very basics and concepts in statistics should be made clear. There are no much books available, which discuss the very basics of statistics, for the students in agriculture and allied sciences. This motivates us to come up with a book that handles statistics with simplicity and lot of examples. We have tried to incorporate MCQs and subjective questions towards the end of each chapter to help the students to prepare for competitive examinations. Note: This book is published by XXXXXXXX.

A German word Statistik, got the meaning collection and classification of data generally in the early 19th century. This word was first introduced by Gottfried Achenwall (1749). Statistik was originally designated as a term for analysis of data about the state (data used by government or other administrative bodies). The term Statistik was introduced into English in 1791 by Sir John Sinclair when he published the first of 21 volumes titled Statistical Account of Scotland (Ball 2004). The first book to have Statistics in its title was Contributions to Vital Statistics (1845) by Francis GP Neison, actuary1 to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office. Figure 1.1: Statistical Account of Scotland by Sir John Sinclair (1749) 1.2 Statistics in ancient times Early evidence of statistical data collection was available from some of the oldest dynasties in the world. The Han Dynasty of China and the Roman Empire were some of the first to extensively gather data on the size of the empires population, geographical area and wealth. The use of statistical methods dates back to at least the 5th century BCE. 1.2.1 The wall of Platea It is given by Thucydides, a historian and general in Athens, ancient Greece, in his scholarly work History of the Peloponnesian War(Thucydides 1985), how the Athenians put use of statistics to scale a wall and win a war. The work recounts the fifth-century BC war between Sparta and Athens until the year 411 BC. Soldiers calculated the height of the wall of Platea by counting the number of bricks in a non-plastered section of the wall. The count was repeated several times by a number of soldiers. The most frequent value (In statistics the term used for the most frequent value in a dataset is Mode) is considered most likely to be the number of bricks in the wall. Multiplying this value by the height of the bricks used in the wall allowed the Athenians to determine the height of the ladders necessary to scale the walls.

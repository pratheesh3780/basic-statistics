Welcome to the book **Introduction to Agricultural Statistics**.

# Preface {-}  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy. Over 70 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture. To ensure food security to the growing population active research is an inevitable part for developing procedures to increase livestock and crop yields, improve farmland productivity, reduce loss due to post harvest handling, disease and insects, develop more efficient equipment and to increase overall food quality. A lot of scientist and students are involved in this process. Surveys, field and lab experiments are an integral part of agricultural research. All these actions generate, what we call data, which need to be carefully examined, understood and visualized for making valid scientific interpretations and conclusions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Statistics, the science of collecting, analysing, presenting, and interpreting data plays an important role in agricultural research and survey. Knowledge in statistics helps you to use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, and effectively present the results. Statistics as a subject is very hard to learn, but if presented in a proper way, it is very fun and interesting. Majority of students and researchers in agriculture and allied sciences didnâ€™t have a mathematical background, which makes it even harder for them to learn and understand the concepts. Before students take this subject seriously for their post graduate and PhD, as it is very much required for research work, they ignore the very basics at the undergraduate level. You can't build a great building on a weak foundation.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before learning statistical tools to apply in your research the very basics and concepts in statistics should be made clear. There are no much books available, which discuss the very basics of statistics, for the students at under graduate level in agriculture and allie sciences. This motivates us to come up with a book that handles statistics with simplicity and lot of examples. We have tried to incorporate MCQs and subjective questions towards the end of each chapter to help the students to prepare for competitive examinations.</p>

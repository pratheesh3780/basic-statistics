# History {#history}
## Origin of the word “Statistics”  
<p style="text-align: justify;">The term statistics was derived from the Neo-Latin word `statisticum collegium` meaning “council of state" and the Italian word `statista` meaning "statesman" or "politician".</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">A German word `Statistik`, got the meaning of the collection and classification of data generally in the early 19th century. This word was first introduced by Gottfried Achenwall (1749), originally designated as a term for analysis of data about the state. The term `Statistik` was introduced into English in 1791 by Sir John Sinclair when he published the first of 21 volumes titled Statistical Account of Scotland [@ball]. The first book to have 'Statistics' in its title was "Contributions to Vital Statistics" (1845) by Francis GP Neison, actuary^[a person who compiles and analyses statistics and uses them to calculate insurance risks and premiums.] to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office.</p>
